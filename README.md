This is the official repository of our paper:
**"StreamVAD: A Streaming Framework with Progressive Context Integration for Multi-Temporal Scale Video Anomaly Detection"** 
![overview](img\overview.png)

## Highlight
- An lightweight streaming video anomaly detection framework is proposed.

- A streaming progressive context integration captures long-term dependencies online.

- A streaming key clip generator reduces redundancy while preserving semantic content.

- A multi-temporal scale selection dynamically adjusts scale and reduces computation.

- The method detects long-term anomalies effectively while maintaining low latency.
## Dataset
We use extracted CLIP features for UCF-Crime and XD-Violence datasets by [VadCLIP](https://github.com/nwpu-zxr/VadCLIP).  The features can be downloaded at [VadCLIP](https://github.com/nwpu-zxr/VadCLIP).

Our long-term video dataset can be downloaded at [OneDrive](https://1drv.ms/f/c/9da13db395f6b4bb/Ev6CnA2zRvhHgk1bA8fxUA0Bq8IV6iRfvbxhI8apFIuGJA?e=d4fQZS)
We also extracted CLIP features, the feature file can be loaded at [OneDrive](https://1drv.ms/f/c/9da13db395f6b4bb/EiBE_sp-rXRElPQOhKkpKjYBxllv5JWAWhvx0wT1Pvux8g?e=ldvOm1)

## Setup
To execute the code on your local setup, you will need to make the following adjustments to the files:
Update the file paths in `list/xd_CLIP_rgb.csv` `list/ucf_CLIP_rgb.csv` and `list/xd_CLIP_rgbtest.csv`  `list/ucf_CLIP_rgbtest.csv` to point to the locations where you have downloaded the datasets.
You have the flexibility to modify the hyperparameters as per your requirements in the file `xd_option.py` and `ucf_option.py`.
The model can be donwload at [OneDrive](https://1drv.ms/f/c/9da13db395f6b4bb/EpbIdDx81stMnKsmtJuah_EBl7Ic6amf4YrOXKdYVf97ig?e=TcxMct)
## Training

Traing for XD-Violence dataset
```
python xd_train.py
```
Traing for UCF-Crime dataset
```
python ucf_train.py
```

## Testing

testing for XD-Violence dataset
```
python xd_test.py
```
testing for UCF-Crime dataset
```
python ucf_test.py
```
testing for long term dataset, Modify `test_list` path and `gt` path, run 
```
python longterm_test.py
```
